            <p>Mark and Luisa first met online on the cusp of March 2020.  Little did they know, while the rest of the world would soon shut down, their hearts remained open. A nervous first date at Marks gym, led to late night conversations and being glued to their cellphones. During the shut downs, they safely went on dates hiking, walking, and developed a deep connection.



</p><p>Mark, being an intelligent, caring, funny, and charming gentlemen found love with Luisa who is kind, sweet, sensitive,and goofy. Luisa shares a similar sense of humor as Mark, laughing at all of his corny jokes. They enjoy trying new resturaunts near and far.  



</p><p>Mark and Luisa are excited to be getting married, celebrating their love with friends and family. They look forward to building their life and love together.
